# ShopHealthy

## Motivation – 

Do you know how healthy your diet was last month? Do you have time to enter every meal that you eat? We are here to provide a solution for this and make sure you shop and eventually eat healthy.

## Problem Statement –
	
	To stay healthy, we need to shop healthy. In order to maintain a healthy lifestyle, smart choices in the grocery store and kitchen are vital in achieving a balanced and nutritious diet. It is never too late to adopt healthier habits and making simple changes to your shopping and cooking routines will help you achieve your goal.
We the SeaWolves are here to make that happen. There are numerous apps that focus on calorie intake or ingredients of a product and how harmless it is for the customer to consume.  All the apps require user to input their meal every step of the day whenever they have a meal to measure their health index. Though it covers an aspect, it totally misses the aspect of foods that are eaten but are not logged maybe due to laziness or memorability. We propose a solution, that will make customers purchase the healthier food in the first place rather than look at health as a consequence of food intake.
Through this app, we look forward to providing a seamless user experience for people to order grocery or food from their local restaurants. The app then using data at its disposal, crunches the numbers for the user and provides a metric on a how well a consumer has eaten over the months/years. 
The app uses details from the users order history and makes recommendations of food/grocery items. Say for example, if the previous order had a fried chips in the cart, then our app would remove it from the cart and move it to section that lists the chips along with other alternatives like baked chips option so that, in case user still wants to order chips, he can choose among the healthier option. Here we plan to use the Google Recommendations API to help us with the recommendations based on the rules in data store.
Our business model will be similar to the aggregator business model, where we would partner with stores to provide the cart items to user. Apart from the existing store apps like Aldi’s, more customers who prefer a healthy lifestyle would continue to order products from these vendors giving them additional business rather than buying from Heath food stores like eat.fit or Thrive market.
